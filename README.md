# Sudoku

## October 2022

Three implementations of solving a Sudoku board: inductive, deductive, and a genetic algorithm. 
Inductive and deductive algorithms both utilize brute force and backtracking algorithms while the genetic algorithm computes scores after each generation and picks the "fittest" board positions. 
Compares the efficiency of each algorithm using the built in timer function.
